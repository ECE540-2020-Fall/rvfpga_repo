Move your desired Proj2demo.S into proj2demo/src and then Assembly/Run

Proj2demo_With_ALL_X_Reg.S is almost all register names with X's
Proj2demo_With_NO_X_Reg.S is with purpose named registers and no X named registers.

Both code files work the same.

Using Unix/Cygwin Sed you can convert between the two but not guaranteed perfect.
sed -f to_nox_regs.sed Proj2demo.S > Proj2demo_With_NO_X_Reg.S
sed -f to_x_regs.sed Proj2demo.S > Proj2demo_With_ALL_X_Reg.S
